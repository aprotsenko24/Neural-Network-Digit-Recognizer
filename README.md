# üß† Neural Network Digit Recognizer (NumPy Only)

This project implements a digit recognizer neural network entirely from scratch using **NumPy**. No high-level machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are used‚Äîonly pure NumPy and low-level matrix operations.

## üîç About the Project

This project was built to gain a deep, hands-on understanding of the internal workings of neural networks. Every core feature‚Äîincluding forward and backward propagation, softmax classification, gradient descent, regularization, and initialization‚Äîis manually implemented.

## üìå Key Features

- **Weight Initialization**:
  - **He Initialization** (for output layer)
  - **Xavier Initialization** (for hidden layers)
- **Activation**:
  - **Leaky ReLU** to avoid dead neurons
- **Output**:
  - **Softmax** layer for classification
- **Loss Function**:
  - Cross-entropy with **L2 Regularization**
- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Learning Rate **Decay** (Exponential)
  - Manual **Gradient Descent**
- **Training Controls**:
  - Modular feedforward/backpropagation logic
  - Custom cost tracking and accuracy evaluation

## üìä Performance

- **Dataset**: MNIST (loaded via `torchvision.datasets`)
- **Training Accuracy**: ~88‚Äì90%  
- **Regularization Impact**: L2 Regularization penalizes weight overgrowth, improving generalization
- **Test Performance**: Final evaluation pending
